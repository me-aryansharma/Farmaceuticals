        <h1>ABOUT US</h1>
		<p>
			We are Team Farmaceuticals consisting of five members, third year engineering students studying in Ajay Kumar Garg Engineering College, Ghaziabad in Uttar Pradesh. We built this project as a part of Smart India Hackathon 2022 contest. We believe that through this approach, we will not only solve the problem of stubble burning and its ill effects on the environment, but we will also help farmers earn some money in return of stubble.
